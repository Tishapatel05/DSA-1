#Majority element 

1.From the given array, assume that starting index ofd the array is the majority element.FRom the targeted comapre rest of the elements.
2.So if youn got same value , increase the count.If you get the different count decrease the count .
3.If counter become 0 , it means til now we havent see any majority element .
4.Again szelect the new target element . very next element is ur target element 
5.At the end of for loop , if ounter is more than 0 , it means there is a majority element.
6.Taking the target  value , count how many times that were repeated in an array. 
7.If the counter is greater n/2 it means that my majority element .

#Longest Consecutive Sequence:

1. Create a set 
2. Run a loop , take the values from the array and push it into the set ,using insert method.
3. Start iterating set values.
4.We have to find whether the element is starting is or not by decreasing the value and checking that value is there or not in the set . 
5. If we got starting value , than start comparing to the values.
