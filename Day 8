#Recursions 
Function call itself and itself till it meets base condition .
There are 2 types of recursion:
1.function calling same function itself and itself 
2.function calling another function till it meets base condition .
If we didnt mention base condition properly we get can an exception called stack overflow.
write a code for factorial using recursion 
5!=5!*4!
4!=4!*3!
3!=3!*2!
2!=2!*1!
1!=1!*0!

sdueo code:
fact(n){
 if(n==0){
  return 1 ;
 else 
  return n * fact(n-1);
 }
}
for every recursive call, elments will be pushed into stack. After reaching base condtion elements will be popped.
For our question, 5,4,3,2,1 all these values will be pushed in stack 
Recursions  are used to break the code

max= Math.max(arr[i],max);
min = Math.min(arr[i],min);

In java we dont have pointers so we cant use references
