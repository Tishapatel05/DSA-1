What is framework??
Framework is nothing but pre defined methods and will guide the program. 

Array list is a class and it contains complete methods. 
Array list is a dynamic array . If array size is 2 and trying to add third element the size will be double and it will copy previos elements vice versa the array will become half .
As aaray list is a class you have to import the array list class.Now we can access all the pre defined methods which consist in array list.
