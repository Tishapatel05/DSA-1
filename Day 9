#Recursions

Q.From agiven string , we  have to remove a charachter using recursions.
A.Assume that we are starting wirh two strings: Input and output at initial output string is empty.
we have few steps:
1). Take the first character from the string and store in a character variable.
2). Check the varibale with our target. If it matches, just return ouptut string, else\
3). Next slice teh string by 1 character .
4).To get a particular character placed at a particular index , we have to use charct()

"Hello"

From a given string skip a entire word and print rest of the character 

From the given string u have to skip he  not hello 


initialize the pointers according to the question.
if u r starting first pointer at 0th indec and 2nd pointer at last index, wheneverb both pointers crosses each other , breaks the loop
in betwwen do the relevant  operation .
