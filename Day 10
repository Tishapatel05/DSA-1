#Strings:
1. String are classes.Arrays are objects.So the sequence of character is called strings.So strings are immmutable. All the array objects will be created inside heap memory. 
Once a string got created it will be created like fixed . It means we cant modified the strings 

// String a = "Hello";
// String b = "Hello";
 System.out.println(a==b);

Is == to compare  address location . 

 System.out.println(a=b);+

= helps to compare data. 
To get array length we have to use array.length method
but to get string length, we use array.length method and it will return no. of characters. 

Convert the string into character array and then reverse it

- length() - Returns the length of the string.
- charAt(int index) - Returns the character at the specified index.
- substring(int beginIndex, int endIndex) - Extracts a portion of the string.
- contains(CharSequence s) - Checks if the string contains the specified sequence.
- startsWith(String prefix) / endsWith(String suffix) - Checks if the string starts/ends with a given substring.
- toUpperCase() / toLowerCase() - Converts the string to uppercase or lowercase.
- trim() - Removes leading and trailing spaces.
- replace(String old, String new) - Replaces occurrences of a substring.
- split(String regex) - Splits the string into an array based on a regex.
- equals(String anotherString) / equalsIgnoreCase(String anotherString) - Compares two strings.

#Subset:
So for a given array , we have to print teh possible arrays . It should be in a sequence but not continuous thats called a subset 
In an array if we have n no. of elments will get  2n subset

In recursion, we have only two possibilites. either if or else and in backtracking we have multiple possibilities in most of the problems , whenever we reach base case , we have to print all the bese case elements
remove last element in every recursive call then the backtracking will complete.5
