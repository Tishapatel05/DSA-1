#Dtuch Flag Algorithm 

1. initialize 3 pointers L at 0th index and M at 0th index, h at n-1 index
Thwe elements between m and h are unsorted so we have to traverse at m and h .
If arr[m] = 0 swap between arr[m] and arr[l] and increase l.
if arr[m] = 1, just increase m.else swap arr[m] and arr[h] and increase h. 

#Collection frameworks 

List                    Set                   Map
.Arraylist           .Hashset               .Hashmap
.Linkedlist          .LinkedHashset         .LinkedHashmap
.Vector              .Treeset               .Treemap

1. List ,set and map these are interfaces. rest of the all terms are classes. Interface contains incomplete methods. class contains complete methods. 
2. List is ordered which can allow duplicates. Set is unordered which  wont accept duplicates. Maps contains key value  pairs.
