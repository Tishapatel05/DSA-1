* Static block and constructor 
    constructors are nothing but to intialized the objects. For every class there will be a default constructor. Whenever to create an object constructor will be called that object will be  created.
Constructor having class name are method properties.

Static block: 
 static block will be created with a static keyword. it will be called automatically. no need to call with either object or class

Static method:
for static method no need to call with object you can directly call with class name and here static will act as instance or object.

Condtitonal Statements:
types : 
if - else, else-if ladder , switch case

conditional statement are used to check the condition and tp print the relevant block in constant time . 
  if  (statement)
    {
      return truee or else return false  
    }
else 
    {
  if gives false then we use this else part 
    }

control statements:
  entry control loop 
     for and while loop 
eg of for: 
 for(start;end; diff)
eg for start:
  start;
  while(end){
     diff;
  }
when we know the range we will use for loop and when we dont know the range we prefer to use while loop
  exit control loop
